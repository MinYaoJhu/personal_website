# Min-Yao Jhu

<img src="Image/2017_aspb.jpg" width="200">

I am a sixth-year Ph.D. candidate in the Plant Biology Graduate Program at UC Davis. I have been doing research in the plant biology field for 10 years. My research interests are plant-parasite interactions, plant biotic stress, and plant-fungal or plant-bacterial symbiosis research. I am currently working in Sinha Lab and I am focusing on parasitic plant research, especially _Cuscuta_ _campestris_. In my current research, I use bioinformatics, genetics, molecular biology, and histology techniques to study haustorium development and the interaction between parasitic plants and tomatoes.
